//got the correct dataMatrix and represting them as numbers

//be careful with rows and columns.You have a tendancy to screw it up
//optimize the main extraction algorithm

//1440*900    ******** 12*96

original working loop

//editing feb 9
// back to rectangles. maybe a better grid system required to understand slants
//add new color pallete
// DVDs were brought only in 2009, no inconsistancy , CDs have been there for a while actually
