According to the visualization, Spanish is the most popular language.This might be because it is widely spoken is and is not just limited to spain but also in central & south america as well as neighbouring mexico. Spanish is recorded the highest volume not just in the books section but also in Cassettes and DVDs. An interesting comparison would be with mandarain or possibly english which the most popular languages. Another interesting observation was the number of checkouts drastically reducing as soon as DVDs were introduced in 2009.There has been a strong demand for spanish DVDs and the number of spanish books being checked out also increased during that period. The introduction in DVDs regained interest in Italian & French languages. There was a marginal incerease in the number of books checkout in this period. However no german DVDs were checkout indicating that they were never introduced to the library.
